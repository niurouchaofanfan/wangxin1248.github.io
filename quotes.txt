Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.
Happiness is a way station between too much and too little.
The hard part isn’t making the decision. It’s living with it.
You may be out of my sight, but never out of my mind.
Love is not a maybe thing. You know when you love someone.
In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.
When the whole world is about to rain, let’s make it clear in our heart together.
Life is a journey, not the destination, but the scenery along the should be and the mood at the view.
Time goes by so fast, people go in and out of your life. You must never miss the opportunity to tell these people how much they mean to you.
I lied when I said I didn’t like you. I lied when I said I didn’t care. I lie every time I try to tell myself I will never fall for you.
Accept what was and what is, and you’ll have more positive energy to pursue what will be.
Until you make peace with who you are, you’ll never be content with what you have.
I’ll think of you every step of the way.
